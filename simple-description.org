The Problem: 

Cell assembling system is a system in which each worker (robot) assembles a complex
product in a relatively small "cell" where the equipments are quickly accessible
with minimum motion.
Compared to the large automated production line, cell
assembling systems suit the demand of assembling relatively small number (~100) of
products, particularly experimental or custom-made products, because of the
flexibility of the system. The problem arises because the assembling plan changes
frequently. To maximize the productivity, the planner have to minimize the total makespan.

PDDL Features: Sequential version: STRIPS, with negated preconditions,
action costs and hierarchical type structure.
Temporal version: Simple temporal STRIPS, i.e.,
actions with durations, but using only the "conservative" fragment of
temporal planning. (:numeric-fluents,:durative-actions)

Objective: 
Products called "bases" are assembled by robot arms in the cells.
Each cell consists of an arm, assembling tables and machines for special
purpose (e.g. oiling, painting).
The objective is to minimize makespan. The temporal version encodes this
objective directly. In the sequential version, cost is used as
an (approximate) proxy for makespan, but a temporal plan must be
produced by post-scheduling the sequential solution plan.

Simplifications and omissions: 
The task is focused on the efficient motion of arms. Job dependencies (e.g. attatching X should
be done before painting Y) should be already encoded in the problem, so guessing
the dependencies is not the task of planners.

Also, the components to be picked up from trays and
attached to bases are free (as in beer) and indistinguishable. When an arm
picks up a part from a tray, it seems as if one part exists in two places at the
same time i.e. (holding arm part) and also (at part tray).  However, this actually
means that there is another part in the tray which was supplied immediately.
