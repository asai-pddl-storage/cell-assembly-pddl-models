* CELL-ASSEMBLY domain

This repository contains a set of data (domain,problems,plans) used in [Asai2014].


+ [Asai2014] Asai, M.; Fukunaga, A: 2014. Fully Automated Cyclic Planning for Large-Scale
  Manufacturing Domains. In /ICAPS 2014/.



** directory =ACP=

It contains 7 directories, each corresponds to one instances of
mass manufacturing problem.
Each directory contains at least the following files:

+ domain.pddl :: a domain file.
+ p1.pddl :: a template problem.
+ p1.plan :: the best template plan obtained by solving it with Fast
             Downward(LAMA2011). Plans were obtained easily and FD has
             searched the entire state space.
+ p4.pddl, ... p1024.pddl :: mass manufacturing
     problems.
+ [modelname]-SS-[MS3..]-TOTAL-[N].plan.total :: solutions obtained
     by ACP for each N-products manufacturing problems.
     *This is a sequential plan before the postprocessing* (minimum-slack
     scheduler) -- our scheduler does not have a proper formatter
     that complies the temporal plan input format of VAL-4, a PDDL+ plan validator.

Additionally, =model.lisp= may contain functions to write the
template problems. Functions used in each script are in
=make-distances.lisp=. 
/You can't/ actually produce the templates with them
because of the library dependencies (my personal and public
library is included, reference to which is a violation of anonymity,
and others are not even public.)
However, I decided to include
them because the scripts are slightly documented
while the actual pddl problems do not contain any comment.

** directory =temporal=

It contains the temporal versions of the domains and problems in =ACP=
directory. They are made in order to run temporal planners =CPT=,
=yahsp= and =DAE_yahsp= on those domains.
They are manually and minimally changed from the original ones
except /Barman/ (so /Barman/ is not included here).
Barman needs no modification because those planners are
able to interpret a cost-unaware standard STRIPS domain as a temporal
domain with all durations set to 1.

The modification detail mainly consists of:

1. translate =:action-costs= -> =:durative-action=
2. stop using =:negative-preconditions=
3. use =TOTAL-TIME= rather than =TOTAL-COST=

** miscellaneous

Below is an illustration of CELL-ASSEMBLY models.
